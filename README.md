**ASHE** is a messy package that gathers various useful tools (at least for me) for reading, analyzing, and writing hydrological and environmental data in R.

**ASHE** stand for Analysis and Statistics for Hydrology and Environment.

This project was carried out for National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Institut National de Recherche pour l’Agriculture, l’Alimentation et l’Environnement, [INRAE](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/inrae-linstitut-national-de-recherche-pour-lagriculture-lalimentation-et-lenvironnement) in french).
